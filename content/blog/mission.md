This blog is about government. It‚Äôs about democracy, about its failures, about history and political theory, stories and beginnings, choices and the universe. It‚Äôs about being human, being a citizen, being part of a country, what that means.... And hopefully, it‚Äôll be about how to make it better.

What is democracy, really? What does it mean to live, in the 21st century? How do modernity and society and citizenship take place in our lives?

### At a Glance

We‚Äôre going to discuss government from first principles - like 1776 all over again. Broadly speaking, we want to understand how the pieces work, so that we can build a better one

#### Principles

- How democracy fails: public choice theory, system design, incentives, game theory. Potential explanations for things like, why your vote doesn‚Äôt matter, and why interest groups are winning

- Alternative models for democracy: deliberative democracy, polycentric democracy

- What are universal rights governments ought to uphold? Theories of rights (Rawls, Nozick, and a lot more) 

- Proposed mechanisms: We‚Äôll also go over some proposed academic theories of how to organize society, from the free market principles (ie, Hayek) to alternatives. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff to unpack, and we‚Äôll also see how some of the stuff fails. Things like: ‚ÄúShock Therapy‚Äù

- Globalization, capitalism, and nations: What this means for us in the 21st century

#### Vision

- Essays about reinventing citizenship, startups, and more...

- Socialism - What do people imagine to be the future of government? How do they suggest bringing it about? will they work? What are the important factors to consider?

- Creating a new political party

#### Practice

- How municipalities work today - what innovation looks like, and who‚Äôs doing it

- Common policies around the world  - things like health care, education, etc. Would it work in the US?

- Electioneering, politics, and how stuff works in the US today - Can you institute change?


### What is Allogov?

It's a project about us all. A movement, a way of life, a belief. That tomorrow is better than today, and that by cooperating, we can achieve a better society.
