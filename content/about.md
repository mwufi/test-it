  description: "I started this project to build a brighter future. The political system of today is broken, no longer reflecting the preferences of the many, but the wishes of the ultra-wealthy.
  
  
  You can make a difference. By understanding the current political system and funding the development of our first project, Government V0.1, we can bring a better system of government to cities and states across the US."
